I'm a Research Associate at Vanderbilt University, Computer Science Department, and got the PhD from the same place. My research interests include data science, machine learning, and artificial intelligence, especially physics-based machine learning, spatial-temporal data mining, uncertainty quantification, federated learning, model validation, etc.
